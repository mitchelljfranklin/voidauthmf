## Credits

Mitch-Auth is a fork of [VoidAuth](https://voidauth.app) by [Derek Paschal](https://github.com/notquitenothing). VoidAuth is an incredible, actively maintained project — if this fork helps you, consider starring the [upstream repository](https://github.com/voidauth/voidauth).

The LDAP Directory Sync feature is built on [ldapts](https://github.com/ldapts/ldapts).

## Upstream

This fork periodically merges changes from [voidauth/voidauth](https://github.com/voidauth/voidauth) to stay current with bug fixes and new features. The fork's additions — LDAP Directory Sync, Admin Settings, multi-arch builds, and operational enhancements — are described throughout this documentation. All upstream VoidAuth documentation applies for core SSO, OIDC, ProxyAuth, and user management features. See the [Introduction](/welcome) page for the full list of fork-specific additions.
